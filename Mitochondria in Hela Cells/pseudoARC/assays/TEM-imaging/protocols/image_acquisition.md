# TEM image acquisition
a. Loading the Sample:

    Mount the grid with the section in the TEM sample holder.

b. Microscope Setup (Jeol 2100):

    Initialization: Start the TEM (Jeol 2100) and ensure the vacuum system is at the required level.
    Alignment: Check and adjust the alignment of the electron beam.

c. Imaging Parameters:

    Voltage: Set the accelerating voltage to a constant 80 kV.
    Magnification: Start imaging at lower magnifications (like 3000x) to locate areas of interest.
    Fine Tuning: Gradually increase magnification up to 25000x for detailed imaging.
    Focus and Stigmation: Adjust focus and stigmation for each magnification level to ensure sharp images.

d. Image Acquisition:

    Capture images using the TEM's camera system. Adjust exposure and contrast as needed.
